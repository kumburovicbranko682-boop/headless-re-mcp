"""In-process HTTP(S) interception via a threaded mitmproxy DumpMaster.

One proxy per session. mitmproxy runs its own asyncio loop, so it lives on a
dedicated thread; a bounded addon records flows into a ring buffer that the
read tools query. mitmproxy is optional and the API differs across versions, so
startup is defensive and a missing module degrades to ``capability_unavailable``.
